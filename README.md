# ColorfulMood
**ColorfulMood** is a mobile application to help you manage your emotions.

## Building the App
1. Set up your environment using Flutter SDK by following the steps [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Build and run the app on your favorite IDE and volia!

## Getting Started
* To get started, click on **Add Entry**. Being a demo app, this will be the first page that appears on screen.
* You will see a grid of 36 colorful boxes, split into 4 sections, indicated by 4 main colors, 
  *red*, *yellow*, *blue*, *green*. They represent anger, elation, melancholy and serenity respectively.
* The *9* boxes in each sections represent the nuances and intensity of each emotion. 
  As we approach the corners of a section, the colors become more vivid
  and corresponding emotions more intense.
* When clicking on a square, for instance a *yellow* square to indicate that you are *happy*, 
  a descriptive adjective will appear at the bottom of the screen, allowing you to confirm if the 
  adjective accurately describes your emotion.
* Following the confirmation, you will be able to record your thoughts in details on the “diary” page. 
  The page allows you to choose the main contributor to your emotion, be it positive or negative. 
  Examples of contributors are the home and the workplace.
* Finally, having input your detailed thoughts, you can choose to **share** them with the *public*, 
  your *friends* or keep it *private*. By sharing it with your *friends*, your record will appear on their 
  community page and they will be able to send you helpful messages.
